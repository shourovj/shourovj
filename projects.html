              <p>In this project, we developed an Inventory Bot which can take real-time voice commands and bring the object mentioned in the voice command using real-time object detection by YOLOv, then grabbing the object with necessary ARM movement and bringing it back to the base with LFR.</p>

              <p>In this project, I trained the VGGIN model on the BreakHis histopathology dataset and achieved 99.628% accuracy on the test dataset. VGGIN is a deep learning model combining VGG-19 and the Inception module.</p>

              <p>We developed a method to control a wheelchair with only the patient's voice commands. Our wheelchair takes voice commands from the patients in any language and in any accent and moves accordingly. [Video]</p>
