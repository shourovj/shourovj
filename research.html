        <h1>Undergraduate Thesis Student (2024 - Present)</h1>
        <p><strong>Department of EEE, Bangladesh University of Engineering & Technology</strong><br>
        Supervisor: <a href="https://khasan.buet.ac.bd/" target="_blank">Dr. Kamrul Hasan </a> </p>
    
        <p>My ongoing thesis is research on the development of a state-of-the-art unsupervised end-to-end deep learning method for Strain Elastography (SE) through the estimation of the displacement field (similar to the estimation of optical flow in computer vision). SE is a medical imaging technique that determines the tissue region strain, which helps detect/classify the tumor/lesion region from the surrounding tissue based on their strain.</p>
    
        <h2>Progress:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Implemented ReUSENet paper in Pytorch.</li>
            <li>Developed a model consisting of a new encoder with TriCrossAttention, Convolutional-LSTM based decoder, and a novel loss for Displacement Field Estimation in Strain Elastography from RF sequence, and implemented this in Pytorch.</li>
            <li>My proposed model achieves results close to SOTA and beats the ReUSENet (implemented) in terms of SNR, CNR, and NRMSE metrics.</li>
        </ul>
